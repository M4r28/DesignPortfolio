              <h5>Main Findings</h5>Users express the importance of creative hobbies in their life. Being invested in their projects they would gladly indulge in the idea of having access to expert advice. However, a big emphasis is put on proper and timely scheduling, responsiveness, reliability, and pricing.</p>

            <h3>User <br /> Interviews</h3>
            <p>Building upon survey findings, I conducted one-hour interviews with three participants. These interviews provided valuable insights into their wants, needs, and behaviors related to the app's value proposition.<br/> Following the user interviews, I delved into <span className='semiBold'>insights synthesis</span>. Through a thorough analysis of the raw data, I categorized the insights into emerging themes that captured the primary priorities of users.</p>
